This program was built for my Human-Comupter Interaction course. It was built as an alternative to Ryerson Universities Ramms portal. The program took advantage of the Universal Windows Platform in order to make a cohesive UI. The code is a combination of C# and Xaml (a markup language that's used by the UWP)
